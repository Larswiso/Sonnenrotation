# Sun-rotation
Calculate the differential rotation of the sun using two images and a few mouse clicks.

## Differential sun rotation
The sun rotates around its own axis. Since it is a ball of gas, it rotates
not uniform, but much faster at the equator than at the
Poland. This is called differential sun rotation.
## Setup
1. Open cmd in Sun-rotation folder and type **pip install -r requirements.txt**
2. Since this program is ONLY tailored for the images from SDO, the images must also be downloaded from there. [To SDO](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aiahmi/)
3. Save the images in the folder **Images**.
4. Enter the file path of the related images in the first two variables. (1st time and 2nd time)
## How it works
