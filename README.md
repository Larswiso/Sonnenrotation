# Sun-rotation
Calculate the differential rotation of the sun using two images and a few mouse clicks.

# differential sun rotation
The sun rotates around its own axis. Since it is a ball of gas, it rotates
not uniform, but much faster at the equator than at the
Poland. This is called differential sun rotation.
